def add(a,b):
x = a + b
return x

print add(3,5) 

output  => 8

def say_hi(name):
	print "Hi, " + name

We define parameters and pass in arguments

We want to return some sort of value that we can use later in out program


A functional call is equal to whatever that function returens

def say_hi():
	return "Hi"
Greeting = say+hi()
print greeting

output = hi

Returning a value from a function allows us to store that value
in a variable
Here we invoked the say_hi function and set it to the greeting variable
When we print greeting we see that it contains the returned value of
say_hit function "hi"

Returning to caller


We returned "Hi"
Set greeting variable to say_hi() function 
so when we print greeting variable it will give the returned value

def add(a,b)
	x = a+b
	return x

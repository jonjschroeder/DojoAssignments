                          <li class="list1">3. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a '200 OK" message, which means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks. </li>
                          <li class="list1">4. The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you!</li>
